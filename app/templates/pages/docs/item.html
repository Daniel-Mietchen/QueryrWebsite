## id

Type: map

Always present and contains at least "wikidata", with the Wikidata.org item id.

Can contain "en.wikipedia" and "$lang.wikipedia", where $lang is the request language. These elements
contain the corresponding page name on the associated Wikipedia, if such a page exists.

## label, description, aliases

These contain data in the request language that corresponds directly to Wikidata items. They are
omitted if there is no value in the request language. Label and description contain a string, while
aliases contains an array of string.

## data

Type: map

Always present, though can be empty.

Contains the data of the item grouped by property. Example:

```json
"Population": {
    "value": 9001,
    "type": "number"
}
```

The keys in the map are the property names in the request language. They point to maps that always
have two keys: "value" and "type". "type" is always a string. The type of "value" depends on "type",
and can be both a scalar or a map.

A third possible key is "values". This key is always an array and only present when there are
multiple values for the property. Only the first most preferred value can be found via "value".
"values" contains all values. The elements in the "values" array are of the same type as value of "value".

The types as value structure is the same as that of the Wikibase software / Wikidata API. However,
some types are modified, such as `wikibase-item`, which will show as a `string` with as value the
label (if available) instead of the item id.
